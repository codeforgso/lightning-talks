# lightning-talks  
Let's start a conversation here to define ways to educate our Brigade on anything and everything we might hack on.  

##What are lightning talks?  
Lightning Talks are short presentations - four or five minutes in length.  

##Who can give these talks?  
Anyone who has knowledge on the topic.  

##Who decides which topics are presented?  
You.  Seriously, add a topic to the list here and we will do our best to find a presenter.

##Want to give a lightning talk to the group?  
Assign the issue (topic) to yourself and let us know when you want to do it.  

##How do I "add an issue"?  
Click on the issues (lightbulb icon) on the right side of the page.  From there, you'll see a green "New Issue" button at the top of the page. Click it, fill it in and remember to give it the label "talk-idea."
